# Near_Project_Movie_Database
Decentralized movie database system on the blockchain. Movie lovers can make several basic functions on the blockchain like add, delete or rate the movies on the database.

This project will ensure basic movie database system to the user.
With using Near Protocol to build this project our database system will be unauthorized and only depends on people's votes and movie knowledge.

In the project view and call methods will be used.
For instance if the user wants to view the ratings of the movie, database will provide it.
Or if the user wants to add new movie to the database, near call command will be used.
For the collections from near-sdk-as PersistentUnorderedMap will be used.
